        2016. The Record Player Song was released on June 21st, 2017, as their
        debut single. It later appeared on their first EP
        <em>I've Got a Few Friends & I Wish They Were Mine</em>, realeased on
        January 19th, 2018. In early 2021, The Record Player Song became a hit

        collaboration with popular indie-pop band AJR.

        <li>I pretend I scraped them climbing in the trees</li>
        <li>Sometimes, I think all I'm ever doing is (Trees)</li>
        <li>Trying to convince myself I'm alive (Trees)</li>
